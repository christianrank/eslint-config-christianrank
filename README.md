# eslint-config-christianrank

The eslint config I'm using in my projects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This config extends the famous [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

I included their source rule as a comment and a comment why I changed something there for every rule.

This config is always specific to my projects, and there's a lot to improve (see todo comments), so you may not want to use it.
